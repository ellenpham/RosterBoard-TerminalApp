**Description**

This is a company internal app to collect the availability and unavailability from casuals to prepare the workforce plan and let the casuals know their roster.

**Features**
1. Casuals input their name and their department (3 options)
2. App menu have 5 prompts : input availability, input unavailability, view roster, change availability/unavailability and exit
3. Casuals are requested to input their availability for the following week based on list of questions (such as available days in a week (Mon to Sun), available shifts (AM, PM, Night)). If they only choose 1-2 available days, they will be promt to choose 1 more day or not getting rostered at all.
4. Casuals are requested for their unavailability for the next 3 week (2 weeks after the following week), also based on list of questions as listed above.

Casuals can view their final roster after they finish inputting their availability/unavailability, the final roster includes their name, department, following week's roster and days that they are not rostered in next 3 weeks (which are their provided unavailability). They can confirm if the roster is correct or they can change their roster - which will be prompted to the next function
